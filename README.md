**Project Objectives:**
Data Cleaning: We'll start by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and ensuring that the data is in a consistent format for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): With the data cleaned and preprocessed, we'll perform EDA using visualizations to gain a comprehensive understanding of the sales trends, popular products, customer demographics, and geographical sales distribution.
Identifying Sales Patterns: We'll analyze historical Diwali sales data to identify recurring patterns, seasonal trends, and peak sales periods to help businesses optimize their inventory and marketing strategies.
Customer Segmentation: By clustering customers based on their purchase behavior, we can identify different customer segments and tailor marketing campaigns accordingly to enhance customer retention and engagement.
Correlation Analysis: We'll explore correlations between various factors, such as discounts, product categories, and customer preferences, to determine their impact on sales performance.
Data Visualizations: Stunning visualizations will be created using Matplotlib and Seaborn, making the data come alive with vibrant colors, adding a touch of the Diwali spirit to the analysis.
